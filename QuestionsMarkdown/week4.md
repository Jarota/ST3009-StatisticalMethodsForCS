# Week 4 Questions

Q1  
a) If $Y = 2$, that means the sum of the dice is 2, which is only true for one outcome -> **{(1,1)}**  
b) Similarly for $Y = 3$, **{(1,2), (2,1)}**  
c) For $Y = 4$, **{(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)}**  
d) There are 3 possible outcomes where $X = 1$, out of a total of $6^2$ possibilities, which gives us $\frac{3}{36} = 0.083$

Q2  
a) The possible values of X are {-3, -1, 1, 3}, ie No heads, one heads, two heads, and three heads.  
b) There are 8 ($2^3$) possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. The chance that X = -3 is the same as the chance all coin flips landed Tails, which is only one outcome, so P(X = -3) = **0.125**  
c) The chance that X = -1 is the same as the chance that there is one Heads out of the three tosses. Using permutations, we get $\frac{3!}{2!} = 3$ possible outcomes, so P(X = -1) = **0.375**  
d) PMF
-   P(X = -3) = 0.125
-   P(X = -1) = 0.375
-   P(X = 1) = 0.375
-   P(X = 3) = 0.125

CDF
-   P(X <= -3) = 0.125
-   P(X <= -1) = 0.5
-   P(X <= 1) = 0.875
-   P(X <= 3) = 1
